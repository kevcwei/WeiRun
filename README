WeiRun is a synchronization tool that post your recent runs to the "Chinese Twitter" Sina Weibo.
The project is based on django, and it's heroku friendly.

Since Nike hasn't released their API yet, I use the same hack as holman's fatigue <https://github.com/holman/fatigue> to
access Nike+ user's information and run history.

I'm a programmer and a beginner runner myself. Who said programmers can't run?
